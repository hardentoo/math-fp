** Universe of programs
The set of all possible programs:

\[ \{ right, wrong \} \]
- Those that behave correctly.
- Those that behave incorrectly.
** Spectrum of possibility
- The most liberal languages let us write any possible program.
- The most restrictive allow only right programs---but usually a subset.
